# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Setup

## Dependencies:
- [React](https://react.dev/learn/installation) (You should install this :D)
- react-DOM (Usually installed with React)
- react-router-DOM (Installed by running step 3)
- prop-types (Installed by running step 3)

## Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (You should install this too)
- npm (This is what you get from installing Node)

## Steps:
1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/27dt/CPS406-Project.git```
2. Change to ```front-end``` directory: ```cd front-end/cps406-project/```
3. Install dependencies: ```npm install``` or ```npm i```
